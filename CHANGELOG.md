# Changelog

## 0.3.0-alpha

- **Buff Digger talks to Buff Digger.** When the player you ask also has the addon, the request arrives silently: a small **Requests** window pops up on their side ("Yann wants Blessing of Might") and one click casts it. No whisper spam.
- If they don't answer within a second and a half, a normal whisper goes out instead.
- A small **star** marks players who have Buff Digger, on their icon and in the Nearby window.
- New setting: *Pop up requests from Buff Digger users* (on by default).
- `/bd selftest` sends yourself a request, to see the Requests window without a friend.
- Open world only: Blizzard blocks addon messages inside dungeons and raids.
- Minimap button tooltip lists what each click does.

## 0.2.0-alpha

- **Pick the buff yourself:** right-click a nameplate icon or a Nearby line for a menu of every buff that player can give.
- **Your own priorities:** reorder your class's buffs in the settings, untick the ones you never want, reset anytime.
- **No-nag delay** is now a setting (1, 2, 5 or 10 min) and survives a /reload.
- **Thank-you messages:** once the buff lands, a thank-you goes out in the same channel as your request (lots of phrasings), on top of the /thank emote. Blizzard needs a real click for /say, so /say thanks go out with your next Buff Digger click or key.
- Thanks work even when the game can't tell who buffed you: Buff Digger matches the buff with the request you just made.
- **Cleaner settings window:** grouped sections, nothing overflows anymore.
- Smoother in crowded cities: icon updates are batched.

## 0.1.0-alpha

- First alpha: nameplate icons, smart buff requests (whisper or /say), Nearby and Give buffs windows, minimap settings.
